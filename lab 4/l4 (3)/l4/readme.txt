for grading copy the file inference.py and factorOperations.py
in your tracking and run autograder.py
4 functions had been edited by us 

The first one make a simple bayles network by assigning them values
In the second function we are implementing the jion factor function 
which basiclly take 2 factor P(X|Y)P(X|Y) and P(Y)P(Y) and yield P(X,Y)P(X,Y). So, joinFactors allows us to incorporate probabilities for conditioned variables (in this case, Y).
In third problem we eliminate the value from the probablity and assign the new problablity.
In question 4, we have eliminated all variables except query and evidence variables.
